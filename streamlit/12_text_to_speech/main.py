# Note: The above code uses gTTS for text-to-speech conversion and Streamlit for the web interface.
# Make sure to install the required libraries using pip:
# pip install streamlit gTTS requests
# Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run main.py
# Open the app in your web browser at the URL provided in the terminal.
# You can enter text, select a language, and convert it to speech. The generated audio can be played and downloaded as an MP3 file.
# The app is simple and user-friendly, allowing for easy text-to-speech conversion.
# You can further enhance the app by adding more features, such as adjusting the speech speed, voice selection, or additional languages.
# This can be done by modifying the gTTS parameters or using other libraries for more advanced text-to-speech capabilities.
# The app can be deployed on platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or any other cloud service that supports Python web applications.
