    "Time series data is a type of data that is collected over time at regular intervals. It is a sequence of data points that are ordered chronologically and can be used to analyze trends, patterns, and behaviors over time. Time series data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as sensors, financial markets, weather stations, and social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of time series data include stock prices, temperature readings, website traffic, and sales data. Time series data can be analyzed using various statistical and machine learning techniques, such as regression analysis, ARIMA models, and deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is often used in forecasting and prediction applications, where the goal is to predict future values based on past observations. Time series analysis can also be used to identify anomalies, trends, and seasonality in the data, which can provide insights into the underlying processes that generate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, time series data is an important type of data that is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, engineering, and social sciences.\n",
