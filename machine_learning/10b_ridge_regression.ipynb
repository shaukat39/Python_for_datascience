    "`Ridge Regression` is a regularized version of Linear Regression: a regularization term equal to $$ \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j^2 $$ is added to the cost function. This forces the learning algorithm to not only fit the data but also keep the model weights as small as possible. Note that the regularization term should only be added to the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to evaluate the model's performance using the unregularized performance measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Regularization` is a technique used in machine learning and statistics `to prevent overfitting` of models on training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. Regularization helps to solve this problem by adding a penalty to the model's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, also known as `Tikhonov regularization`, is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. The key idea behind ridge regression is to find a new line that doesn't fit the training data as well as ordinary least squares regression, in order to achieve better generalization to new data. This is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity (independent variables are highly correlated) or when the number of predictors (features) exceeds the number of observations."

    "**Regularization**: Ridge regression adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This penalty term (squared L2 norm) shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but it doesn't make them exactly zero."
